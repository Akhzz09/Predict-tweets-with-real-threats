we classify twitter tweets into disaster and non disaster tweets 

we used BERT model to classify the twitter tweet data, we took the data from the kaggle website.
we also added the Multinomial Naive Bayes model to compare BERT with and checks its accuracy and found BERT  is best suited for the task and hence we use BERT
